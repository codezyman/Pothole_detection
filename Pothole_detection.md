This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook-based project focused on the detection of potholes in images. The project aims to leverage computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify road damage, which can be crucial for infrastructure maintenance and public safety.

The `Pothole_Detection.ipynb` notebook likely contains the entire workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization of results. While the specific algorithms used are not detailed, common approaches for such tasks include image classification, object detection (e.g., using models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN), or semantic segmentation.

This project serves as a foundational example for developing image-based solutions for road defect analysis.

## Features

*   **Image Loading & Preprocessing**: Handles the loading of image datasets and necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization).
*   **Model Implementation**: Contains the code for a machine learning or deep learning model designed for pothole detection.
*   **Training & Evaluation**: Includes scripts or sections for training the model on a dataset and evaluating its performance.
*   **Visualization**: Demonstrates how to visualize detection results on example images.
*   **Modular Notebook Structure**: Organized into logical sections within the Jupyter Notebook for clarity.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python and several common data science and machine learning libraries.

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codezyman/Pothole_detection.git
    cd Pothole_detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages**:
    While a `requirements.txt` is not provided, based on the project nature, you will likely need the following. You can install them manually or create a `requirements.txt` file yourself:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow # or pytorch
    ```
    *Note: If you encounter issues, you might need to install specific versions or additional libraries depending on the exact implementation within the notebook. Common dependencies for image processing and deep learning include `opencv-python`, `tensorflow` (or `pytorch`), `keras`, `scikit-image`, etc.*

## Usage

Once you have installed the prerequisites and dependencies, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook/Lab**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook**:
    In your web browser, navigate to the Jupyter interface and open the `Pothole_Detection.ipynb` file.

3.  **Run Cells**:
    Execute the cells sequentially within the notebook. The notebook typically guides you through data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation. You might need to specify paths to your dataset if it's not included in the repository or automatically downloaded.

    **Example Notebook Flow (Conceptual):**
    ```python
    # Cell 1: Import Libraries
    import numpy as np
    import cv2 # OpenCV for image processing
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    # import tensorflow as tf # or torch

    # Cell 2: Load Dataset (placeholder - replace with actual dataset loading)
    # Assume images are in a 'data/images' folder and labels in 'data/labels.csv'
    # images = load_images_from_directory('data/images')
    # labels = pd.read_csv('data/labels.csv')
    print("Dataset loaded successfully.")

    # Cell 3: Preprocessing Example
    # def preprocess_image(image_path):
    #     img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    #     img = cv2.resize(img, (224, 224)) # Example resize
    #     img = img / 255.0 # Normalize pixel values
    #     return img
    print("Preprocessing steps defined.")

    # Cell 4: Model Definition (placeholder - replace with actual model)
    # from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
    # from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
    # model = Sequential([
    #     Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    #     MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    #     Flatten(),
    #     Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # For binary classification
    # ])
    # model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    print("Model defined and compiled.")

    # Cell 5: Training the Model (placeholder)
    # model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
    print("Model training completed.")

    # Cell 6: Prediction and Visualization (placeholder)
    # test_image = preprocess_image('path/to/test_image.jpg')
    # prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(test_image, axis=0))
    # if prediction[0][0] > 0.5:
    #     print("Pothole detected!")
    # else:
    #     print("No pothole detected.")
    # plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread('path/to/test_image.jpg'), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
    # plt.title(f"Prediction: {'Pothole' if prediction[0][0] > 0.5 else 'No Pothole'}")
    # plt.show()
    print("Predictions made and results visualized.")
    ```
